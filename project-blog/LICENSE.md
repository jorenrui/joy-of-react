This project is provided as part of the Joy of React (https://www.joyofreact.com/) online course. It is primarily intended to be used as training, to help students of the course develop proficiency with the underlying technologies.

If you'd like to use this project as the starting code for your _own_ blog, you may do so, provided the following conditions are met:

1. You have purchased a copy of the “Ultimate” package of The Joy of React. Only registered students are permitted to use this project. If you're not already a student, you can purchase a copy at https://www.joyofreact.com/.

2. You delete all included blog posts, like “Understanding the JavaScript Modulo Operator”. Only your own original articles should be published on your blog.

3. **You have not removed, edited, or obfuscated the attribution** found in the `src/components/Footer/Footer.js` component. You may not edit the text, nor remove/change the `href` on the links. You can update the styles as long as the attribution remains equally prominent / high-contrast.

As long as these conditions are met, you're welcome to use this project as the foundation for your new blog. I'm excited to see what you do with it!

And so, the primary purpose of this project is training as part of “The Joy of React”. The secondary purpose is to serve as the foundation for your own personal developer blog. **These are the only permitted use cases for this repository.** It is forbidden to use these contents in any other endeavour, including but not limited to:

• Reselling its contents as part of a different course or training program.
• Selling this project as a template or theme.
• Any other sort of commercial endeavour.

Exemptions can be made, on a case-by-case basis. Contact Josh Comeau (support@joshwcomeau.com) for more information.
